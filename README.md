# Simple Load Balancer with Round Robin Algorithm
### This project is a basic implementation of a load balancer in Go using the Round Robin algorithm. The load balancer distributes incoming HTTP requests to a set of backend servers in a circular order.

## A load balancer performs the following functions:

- Distributes client requests/network load efficiently across multiple servers
- Ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to servers that are online
- Provides the flexibility to add or subtract servers as demand dictates
